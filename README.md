MapleQuest EEGstudio is an Open Source project written by MapleQuest Innovations
to support the use of processed EEG monitors in anesthesia, particularly
Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA).

MQ EEGstudio can also be used for visualization and processing of EEG from
other sources, such as brain-computer interfaces and conventional many-electrode monitors.

Development of this tool is supported in part by the 2023 World Federation
of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) Fresenius-Kabi Innovation Award
and the 2024 Society for Technology in Anesthesia Research Grant.
